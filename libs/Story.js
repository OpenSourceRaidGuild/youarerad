          reach out. Nights were filled with long talks about life and hardship, while each day
          recruited members interested in helping. Although our founder intended to help just one

          Now joined by many others, our founder and the guild spoke with people all over the world.
          Their conversations brought warmth and shared hope, but therapy promised even more.
          Helping people find a therapist and begin the healing process became a core part of the
          guild. However, for those unable to afford therapy,

          Changing mental health care became their end-game. The cost of therapy was a new raid.

        <p>
          Desperate to make therapy available to everyone in need, the guild settled on a wild idea:
          they would sell in-game services to pay for therapy. All of their time spent playing games
          made for little money personally, but a great deal of skill and game knowledge. Those
          looking to trade dollars for access to powerful items would fuel the mental health care of
          many.

          Word of Anxiety Gaming spread quickly with the rise of Twitch.tv; eventually reaching
          Trick2G,- the largest Twitch.tv partner at the time. He believed in the ability of gamers
          to unite and overcome any challenge in the world. Many of his viewers agreed, including
          legendary rock band Imagine Dragons. On March 21st, 2016, Trick2G, Dyrus, Wildturtle,
          NightBlue3, FaZe Jev, SirchEz, and Imagine Dragons came together to fundraise for our
          cause.
