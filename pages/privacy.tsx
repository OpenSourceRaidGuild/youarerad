          depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy.
          For example, if you have provided us with personal information such as an email address
          when contacting us about a specific enquiry, we may retain this information for the
          duration of your enquiry remaining open as well as for our own records so we may
          effectively address similar enquiries in future. If your personal information is no longer
          required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details
          that identify you.{' '}
